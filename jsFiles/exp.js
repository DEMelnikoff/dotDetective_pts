                <p>In Dot Detective, you'll see a series of grids. Each grid will contain <span style="color: red">red</span> dots and <span style="color: blue">blue</span> dots.
                <br>The number of dots will change over time.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, the average number of <span style="color: red">red</span> dots will be greater than the average number of <span style="color: blue">blue</span> dots.</p>
                <p>Other times, the average number of <span style="color: blue">blue</span> dots will be greater than the average number of <span style="color: red">red</span> dots.</p>
                <p><strong>Your job is to detect whether there are more <span style="color: red">red dots</span> or <span style="color: blue">blue dots</span> on average.</strong></p>

                more <span style="color: red">red dots</span> or <span style="color: blue">blue dots</span>, and sometimes it will be very difficult.</p>

                <p><strong>No matter how difficult it seems, there is always a correct answer!<br>Even if the number of <span style="color: red">red dots</span> or <span style="color: blue">blue dots</span>
